I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a <u> video of my last lecture,</u> which was not about computer science.
Khan Academy now carries <u>algorithms tutorials</u> for which <u>Devin Balkcom</u> and I produced content.
Are you looking for solutions to exercises and problems in<i> Introduction to Algorithms</i>?
If you are, then see the <u>frequently asked question and answer</u> below.

If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.

    <h3>From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <u>Dartmouth Institute for Writing and Rhetoric.</u>
        I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish
        a <u>list of usage rules</u> that I required my students to observe.

        In 2015, PRI's "The World" ran <u>a story on mentoring women in computer science</u> in which a couple of my
        students and I were interviewed.
        I was interviewed for the Command Line Heroes podcast "Learning the BASICs."
        You can also hear me spout off in "Philosophical Trials #7."
        I talked about writing Introduction to Algorithms in an episode of "Frank Stajano Explains."
        And an interview with a Brazilian vlogger.
